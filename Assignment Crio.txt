Create a simple file based one table database. It should be a simple text file which holds one table.
The metadata about the table, the names of the columns and the types of the columns should be in a
different table file.
Support integers and character data types for now.
Whenver the user creates a table, the syntax will be of the form CREATE TABLE ( col1 INTEGER, col2
STRING,....). It can have any number of columns.This query will be parsed and info stored in
the metadata file.
Whenever the user issues an insert command the insert will happen in the table file.The insert will be of
the form INSERT into <Table> VALUES (col1, col2,..) VALUES(<value1>,<value2>)..

The SQL statements should be passed to a spring boot/flask program. It should be able to save the SQL
statement and success/failure in a redis table .
Docker files need to be created for the program and redis and the candidate should be able to run it off
his laptop.
